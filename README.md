openvac - dev vacancy template that makes sense
=======

As developer you probably  tired of all "we are growing company" and "you need to have at least 3 years of experience with (Java, C#, PHP,..., VB)"

For me as a developer it is important to know **exactly** what technologies I will work with, what **exactly** the product is and who I will work with.
