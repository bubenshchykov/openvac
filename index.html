<p>Jonas joined Debitoor after working for several Scandinavian startups, making him a very well-rounded developer.

<label>Allan</label>
<p>When other people go on vacation, they tend to put their computers away. Allan is just the opposite: he keeps his computer close at hand and hacks new things (like js debugging service Muscula). Allan gives public talks and contributes regularly to tech blogs. He is also married and has two daughters.</p>

<div class="span6"><img src="https://debitoor.com/img/0208-gl-dan-rasmussen-2012-10-19.jpg"/>
<label>Dan</label>
<p>Colleagues refer to Dan as Mr. Whitespace, because he likes his code to look elegant and uncrowded. His ideal weekend getaway is to jump on a boat and go fishing off the Danish coast. His tinted glasses make Dan the most likely candidate for the role of Agent Smith, if Matrix will ever be re-enacted in the Debitoor office.</p>
